      <description>The paper &amp;ldquo;Implicit Communication in a Joint Action&amp;rdquo;, by Ross Knepper, Christoforos Mavrogiannis, Julia Proft, and Claire Liang, has been accepted to HRI 2017.
From the paper:
 Actions performed in the context of a joint activity comprise two aspects: functional and communicative. The functional component achieves the goal of the action, whereas its communicative component, when present, expresses some information to the actorâ€™s partners in the joint activity. The interpretation of such communication requires leveraging information that is public to all participants, known as common ground.</description>

      <description>The paper &amp;ldquo;Decentralized Multi-Agent Navigation Planning with Braids&amp;rdquo;, by Christoforos Mavrogiannis and Ross Knepper, was presented at WAFR 2016.
From the paper:
 We present a novel planning framework for navigation in dynamic, multi-agent environments with no explicit communication among agents, such as pedestrian scenes. Inspired by the collaborative nature of human navigation, our approach treats the problem as a coordination game, in which players coordinate to avoid each other as they move towards their destinations.</description>
