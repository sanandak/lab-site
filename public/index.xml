      <description>Claire is a Senior in Computer Science working on the Hanabi Implicature Project. In this work she is developing a game AI that she believes matches human intuition&amp;rsquo;s use of implicature and is exploring the impact of quantity of presented information in the game&amp;rsquo;s user interface. She has previously worked on stem cell population simulation including spatial modeling, and protein crystallizability prediction. Her current interests lie in mathematics - specifically geometry and topology - and its use in a broad range of real world modeling questions.</description>

      <description>I am a senior computer science major in the College of Engineering at Cornell University. My current research interests lie in the areas of human-robot interaction, computer vision, and augmented reality. I am also a member of Cornell&amp;rsquo;s Robotic Personal Assistants Lab run by Prof. Ross Knepper. Currently, I am working on a telepresence robot equipped with a 360 degree RGB-D sensor. The goal is to use the data coming from the sensor to enable the robot to seamlessly and smoothly navigate crowded pedestrian environments.</description>

      <title>Social Navigation</title>

      <description>Despite the great progress in the field of robotic navigation over the past few decades, navigating a human environment remains a hard task for a robot, due to the lack of formal rules guiding traffic, the lack of explicit communication among agents and the unpredictability of human behavior. Existing approaches often result in robot motion that is hard to read, which causes unpredictable human reactions to which the robot in turn reacts to, contributing to an oscillatory joint behavior that hinders humansâ€™ paths.</description>

      <title>Situated Gesture and Speech</title>
      <link>https://rpal.cs.cornell.edu/data/gestures/</link>

      <guid>https://rpal.cs.cornell.edu/data/gestures/</guid>
      <description>As a part of our work on unfamiliar gesture recognition, we encountered a need for a large, high-quality dataset of situated gesture and speech &amp;mdash; gestures and speech used at the same time by the same person to describe the same things. Such a dataset is central to our approach to zero-shot learning for gesture understanding (Thomason and Knepper, 2016). As we were unable to find a large dataset of this type, we collected this dataset during 2016 and 2017.</description>

      <title>Unfamiliar Gestures</title>
      <link>https://rpal.cs.cornell.edu/projects/gestures/</link>

      <description>Human communication is highly multimodal, including speech, gesture, gaze, facial expressions, and body language. Robots serving as human teammates must act on such multimodal communicative inputs from humans, even when the message may not be clear from any single modality. In this paper, we explore a method for achieving increased understanding of complex, situated communications by leveraging coordinated natural language, gesture, and context.
Our work departs from the traditional model of gesture recognition in that the set of gestures it can recognize is not limited to the gestural lexicon used for its training.</description>

      <description>Primary objectives are to (1) build a control system that enables persistent autonomy. (2) Develop a power system that is capable of operating the blimp and processing hardware using attached solar panels. (3) Develop computer vision algorithms to support research efforts, scientific observations of natural phenomena, and path planning activity. A sensor package will be designed with collaborators at the International Livestock Research Institute in Kenya for prediction of drought. Other future applications include surveillance of remote territory and disaster monitoring.</description>

      <title>Paper Accepted to HRI 2017</title>
      <link>https://rpal.cs.cornell.edu/news/hri2017/</link>

      <guid>https://rpal.cs.cornell.edu/news/hri2017/</guid>
      <description>The paper &amp;ldquo;Implicit Communication in a Joint Action&amp;rdquo;, by Ross Knepper, Christoforos Mavrogiannis, Julia Proft, and Claire Liang, has been accepted to HRI 2017.
From the paper:
 Actions performed in the context of a joint activity comprise two aspects: functional and communicative. The functional component achieves the goal of the action, whereas its communicative component, when present, expresses some information to the actorâ€™s partners in the joint activity. The interpretation of such communication requires leveraging information that is public to all participants, known as common ground.</description>

      <description>The paper &amp;ldquo;Decentralized Multi-Agent Navigation Planning with Braids&amp;rdquo;, by Christoforos Mavrogiannis and Ross Knepper, was presented at WAFR 2016.
From the paper:
 We present a novel planning framework for navigation in dynamic, multi-agent environments with no explicit communication among agents, such as pedestrian scenes. Inspired by the collaborative nature of human navigation, our approach treats the problem as a coordination game, in which players coordinate to avoid each other as they move towards their destinations.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™m interested in facilitating collaboration between robots and humans by computationally expressing findings from social and cognitive psychology to model human behavior and appropriately design robot behavior. Currently, I am working on how humans form expectations of social robots and how we can help people form more accurate mental models of them. When not doing research, I enjoy debating (competitively), watching movies, and traveling.</description>

His PhD research is focused on the design of navigation planning algorithms for robots operating in crowded environments. Inspired by insights from cognitive science and psychology, he employs tools from topology, motion planning and machine learning to address the problem of generating socially competent robot behaviors in pedestrian environments.</description>
