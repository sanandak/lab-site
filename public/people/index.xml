      <description>&lt;p&gt;Claire is a Senior in Computer Science working on the Hanabi Implicature Project.  In this work she
is developing a game AI that she believes matches human intuition&amp;rsquo;s use of implicature and is
exploring the impact of quantity of presented information in the game&amp;rsquo;s user interface.  She has
previously worked on stem cell population simulation including spatial modeling, and protein
crystallizability prediction. Her current interests lie in mathematics - specifically geometry and
topology - and its use in a broad range of real world modeling questions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a senior computer science major in the College of Engineering at Cornell University. My current research interests lie in the areas of human-robot interaction, computer vision, and augmented reality. I am also a member of Cornell&amp;rsquo;s Robotic Personal Assistants Lab run by Prof. Ross Knepper. Currently, I am working on a telepresence robot equipped with a 360 degree RGB-D sensor. The goal is to use the data coming from the sensor to enable the robot to seamlessly and smoothly navigate crowded pedestrian environments. More details about me can be found on my website.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Julia is a first-year PhD student in computer science. Her research interests are in robotics and human-robot interaction, in particular developing shared-control algorithms that make robots easier to teleoperate and leverage the complementary strengths of the human operator and the robot. She also works part-time for the Anita Borg Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to connecting, supporting, and inspiring women in technology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://rpal.cs.cornell.edu/people/minae/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m interested in facilitating collaboration between robots and humans by computationally expressing
findings from social and cognitive psychology to model human behavior and appropriately design robot
behavior. Currently, I am working on how humans form expectations of social robots and how we can
help people form more accurate mental models of them.  When not doing research, I enjoy debating
(competitively), watching movies, and traveling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christoforos received a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece in 2013. He is currently a PhD candidate in the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.  His PhD research is focused on the design of navigation planning algorithms for robots operating in crowded environments. Inspired by insights from cognitive science and psychology, he employs tools from topology, motion planning and machine learning to address the problem of generating socially competent robot behaviors in pedestrian environments. In the past he has done research on Robotic Grasping, Manipulation and Robotic/Prosthetic Hand design.&lt;/p&gt;
