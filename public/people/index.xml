      <description>&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m interested in facilitating collaboration between robots and humans by computationally expressing
findings from social and cognitive psychology to model human behavior and appropriately design robot
behavior. Currently, I am working on how humans form expectations of social robots and how we can
help people form more accurate mental models of them.  When not doing research, I enjoy debating
(competitively), watching movies, and traveling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ross A. Knepper is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University. His research focuses on the theory, algorithms, and mechanisms of automated assembly and human-robot collaboration. Previously, Ross was a Research Scientist in the Distributed Robotics Lab at MIT. Ross received his M.S and Ph.D. degrees in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University in 2007 and 2011. Before his graduate education, Ross worked in industry at Compaq, where he designed high-performance algorithms for scalable multiprocessor systems; and also in commercialization at the National Robotics Engineering Center, where he adapted robotics technologies for customers in government and industry. Ross has served as a volunteer for Interpretation at Death Valley National Park, California.&lt;/p&gt;
