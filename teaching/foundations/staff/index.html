      <p>Ross A. Knepper is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer
Science at Cornell University. His research focuses on the theory,
algorithms, and mechanisms of automated assembly. Previously, Ross was a
Research Scientist in the Distributed Robotics Lab at MIT. Ross received
his M.S and Ph.D. degrees in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University in
2007 and 2011. Before his graduate education, Ross worked in industry at
Compaq, where he designed high-performance algorithms for scalable
multiprocessor systems; and also in commercialization at the National
Robotics Engineering Center, where he adapted robotics technologies for
customers in government and industry. Ross has served as a volunteer for
Interpretation at Death Valley National Park, California.</p>
