This plugin will automatically upgrade your wiki to the newest available DokuWiki version. Before continuing, you should read the <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/changes" class="interwiki iw_doku" title="https://www.dokuwiki.org/changes">Changelog</a> to check if there are any additional steps for you to perform before or after upgrading.
</p>

<p>
To allow automatic upgrading, the PHP process requires write permissions for Dokuwiki files. The plugin will check for the necessary file permissions before starting the upgrade process.
</p>

<p>
This plugin will not upgrade any installed plugins or templates.

<p>
We recommend that you create a backup of your wiki before continuing.
