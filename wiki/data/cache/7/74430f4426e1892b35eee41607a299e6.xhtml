This wiki section serves as a catalog of all the [non-trivial] tools available in the lab. Information such as tool manuals/instructions, warranty info, serial #&#039;s, etc. all belong here. If you buy a fancy new tool, please add its info here so others can easily find how to use and/or fix it.

Unless noted otherwise, electronics tools should be stored around the dedicated lab electronics bench (e-bench). Electronics tools can be an unfortunate combination of expensive and sensitive to improper use, so be sure to exercise caution when using these instruments. If you aren&#039;t sure how to use something or it look particularly expensive, be sure to ask the lab electronics guru.
