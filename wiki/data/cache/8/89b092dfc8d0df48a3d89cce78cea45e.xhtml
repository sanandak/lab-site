This page holds the lab computer registry, including locations, descriptions (<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>, hardware, etc.), status (operational, missing, etc.), current use, login info if necessary, and any other notes. Basically, as with all the other registries on this wiki, this is a means of keeping track of all the computers in the lab so (1) the chance of one going missing is minimized, and (2) anyone can find info on a given PC without having to hunt down people in the lab who might know. Please keep this registry up to date!
