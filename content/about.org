#+TYPE: about

Penn State Ice and Climate is an interdisciplinary group of
researchers from across the university dedicated to a better
understanding of the cryosphere.  We are a part of the
[[http://eesi.psu.edu][Earth and Environmental Sciences Institute]], with members from the
Departments of [[http://www.geosc.psu.edu][Geosciences]], [[http://www.ee.psu.edu][Electrical Engineering]], [[http://meteo.psu.edu][Meteorology]], and
others. 

PSICE folks are conducting field work and  research in many parts of
Antarctica.  The highlighted boxes show some of those areas.  See the [[/projects][Projects]] page for more 
information. [fn:1]

Our mission is the educate the next generation of cryosphere
scientists and  inform the public and other stakeholders on climate
issues.  
Our research mission is to develop the tools and theoretical
framework to better project how climate change will affect ice sheets.

  - Research shows that [[http://blogs.agu.org/geospace/2017/04/26/sea-level-rising-faster-now-1990s-new-study-shows/][sea level]] is rising faster than in the 1990s.

[fn:1] The highlighted boxes are shown with ice flow speed in color. The purple colors show areas where the flow of the ice is less than 3 m/yr.  The yellow colors show regions where the flow speed is 60 m/yr, and the red colors are for areas with speeds of 300 m/yr.  The brown colors are for areas with speeds greater than 1000 m/yr.
