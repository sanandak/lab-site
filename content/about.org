Penn State Ice and Climate is an interdisciplinary group of
researchers from across the university dedicated to a better
understanding of the cryosphere.  We are a part of the
[[http://eesi.psu.edu][Earth and Environmental Sciences Institute]], with members from the
Departments of [[http://www.geosc.psu.edu][Geosciences]], [[http://www.ee.psu.edu][Electrical Engineering]], [[http://meteo.psu.edu][Meteorology]], and
others.

The cryosphere is defined as the part of the Earth where water exists
as ice.  The PSICE group is particularly interested in glaciers and
ice sheets.  The two largest extant ice sheets on Earth are the
Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets, shown here in blue, and to scale.

Ice sheets are part of the global /hydrologic cycle/, in which water
evaporates from the oceans, falls as snow on the ice sheets, is 
compressed over time to form ice, and eventually flows to the ocean and melts.

The /balance/ between snowfall on the ice sheets and water returned to the ocean 
each year is what controls sea level.  The flow of ice is key to this process.

PSICE folks are conducting field work, modeling, and laboratory
research in many parts of Antarctica and Greenland to understand ice
flow in order to better project sea level in the coming decades.  The
highlighted boxes show some of those areas.  See the [[/projects][Projects]] page for
more information. [fn:1]

Our mission is the educate the next generation of cryosphere
scientists and  inform the public and other stakeholders on climate
issues.  
Our research mission is to develop the tools and theoretical
framework to better project how climate change will affect ice sheets.

[fn:1] The highlighted boxes are shown with ice flow speed in color. The purple colors show areas where the flow of the ice is less than 3 m/yr.  The yellow colors show regions where the flow speed is 60 m/yr, and the red colors are for areas with speeds of 300 m/yr.  The brown colors are for areas with speeds greater than 1000 m/yr.
