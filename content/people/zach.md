I am a senior computer science major in the College of Engineering at Cornell University. My current research interests lie in the areas of human-robot interaction, computer vision, and augmented reality. I am also a member of Cornell's Robotic Personal Assistants Lab run by Prof. Ross Knepper. Currently, I am working on a telepresence robot equipped with a 360 degree RGB-D sensor. The goal is to use the data coming from the sensor to enable the robot to seamlessly and smoothly navigate crowded pedestrian environments. More details about me can be found on my website.
