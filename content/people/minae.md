Iâ€™m interested in facilitating collaboration between robots and humans by computationally expressing
findings from social and cognitive psychology to model human behavior and appropriately design robot
behavior. Currently, I am working on how humans form expectations of social robots and how we can
help people form more accurate mental models of them.  When not doing research, I enjoy debating
(competitively), watching movies, and traveling.
