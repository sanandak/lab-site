Byron is a PSICE alum, an Associate Professor at [[http://dubois.psu.edu][Penn State DuBois]], and is a member of the Department of Geosciences Graduate Faculty. He teaches undergraduate courses in Mathematics, Earth Sciences, and Computer Sciences. His NSF- and NASA-funded projects focus on numerical modeling of ice-sheet dynamics and related Earth-system processes.
