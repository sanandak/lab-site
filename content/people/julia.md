Julia is a first-year PhD student in computer science. Her research interests are in robotics and human-robot interaction, in particular developing shared-control algorithms that make robots easier to teleoperate and leverage the complementary strengths of the human operator and the robot. She also works part-time for the Anita Borg Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to connecting, supporting, and inspiring women in technology.
