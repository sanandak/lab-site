Emily is a second year M.Sc. student with PSICE. She graduated from the Colorado School of Mines with a degree in geophysical engineering, focusing on computational and applied mathematics, geology, and planetary sciences. She is currently part of a collaborative effort to improve both the performance of the Ice Sheet Systems Model (ISSM) as well as projections of Antarcticaâ€™s potential contribution to global sea level as a result of external forcing. Her portion of the project involves modeling the stability and evolution of a coupled glacier system in the Amundsen Sea Embayment, an area in WAIS particularly vulnerable to retreat. Emily enjoys traveling, photography, and running in her time away from the computer, and is perpetually torn over whether she would rather have had dinner with Alfred Wegener or Carl Sagan.
