Sridhar is a Professor in the Department of Geosciences and an
associate of the Earth and Environmental Sciences Institute
(EESI). Sridhar teaches geophysics and glaciology and conducts
research in as many cold places as he can convince folks to let him
visit. So far he has done most of his fieldwork in West Antarctica and
Greenland, with the occasional foray to Norway and Iceland. His
interests involve using geophysical tools (seismology, ice penetrating
radar, and GPS) to work out how and why glaciers flow in the ways they
do. He was hooked on glaciology on his first trip to Antarctica and is
still delighted every time he can stand on a glacier.
