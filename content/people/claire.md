Claire is a Senior in Computer Science working on the Hanabi Implicature Project.  In this work she 
is developing a game AI that she believes matches human intuition's use of implicature and is 
exploring the impact of quantity of presented information in the game's user interface.  She has 
previously worked on stem cell population simulation including spatial modeling, and protein 
crystallizability prediction. Her current interests lie in mathematics - specifically geometry and 
topology - and its use in a broad range of real world modeling questions.
