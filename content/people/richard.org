Richard is an [[https://www.research.psu.edu/ovpr/faculty-honors/evan-pugh][Evan Pugh Professor]] of the Pennsylvania State
University, as well as a Professor in the Department of Geosciences.
Richard is a glaciologist with training in geology and materials
science from Ohio State and Wisconsin. He studies the flow and
stability of ice sheets, their climate records, and the way they
interact with the landscape. He used to spend a lot of time on ice
sheets; now, he cheers for students going to the field and stays home
to teach, and communicate with the public and policymakers. He likes
to bicycle and play soccer, and spend time with his family.
