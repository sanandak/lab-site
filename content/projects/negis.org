The North East Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS) is, unsurpisingly enough,
in NE Greenland, flows to the NE and out to the ocean.  NEGIS is
unusual among Greenland's glacier in that it originates far in the
interior of the ice sheet and doesn't have a clearly delineated trough
through which it flows.  The NEGIS grounding line is vulnerable to
melt and retreat due to ocean warming, and the question PSICE is
studying is when and to what degree the interior of the ice stream
will be affected by the coastal changes.
