Who We Are:

We are a project team working to build an autonomous blimp capable of long-term independent flight. Our team is primarily student run under the advisement of Professor Ross Knepper. The team is organized into 3 primary sub-teams: hardware, simulation, and software. Areas of interest are high-level motion planning, circuit design, sensor fusion, dynamics modeling, power system design, and computer vision. 

What We’re Looking For:

At this time we’re looking for students of all levels with interest and experience in any of the following areas:

- CAD
- Circuit design
- Software architecture and design

We’re especially interested in Electrical Engineering students. The are also opportunities for M.Eng. students to design a project with the blimp team. Freshman are free to inquire but should be willing to devote time to bring their skills up to speed.
