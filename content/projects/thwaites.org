Thwaites Glacier is one of the largest glaciers in Antarctica.  Like
many glaciers in West Antarctica, it is /grounded/ below sea level and
the bed becomes deeper farther from the coast (a /reverse bed slope/).
What that means is is that Thwaites is vulnerable to rapid
/grounding-line retreat/ in response to a warming ocean.

We are conducting numerical modeling, satellite and airborne remote
sensing data analysis, and ground-based geophysical measurements to better
project Thwaites Glacier's potential contribution to sea level rise
over the coming decades and centuries.
