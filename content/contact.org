Here is a photo of the massive crack that eventually led to the
formation of the massive iceberg that broke off from the Larsen C Ice
Shelf.  Scale is difficult to measure (the photo was taken from an
airplane, and there are no known features---buildings, trees, roads---
nearby).  NASA estimates that the crack is 100 m (300 ft) in width.
