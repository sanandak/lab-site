(alternatively, scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the ~Tagged: hugo~ link, which will show all the pages tagged ~hugo~).

* Sections

Each file or directory in ~/content~ is /section/.  To customize
the content, place a file in ~/layouts/section~.  The default for
this theme (in the absence of a file in ~/layouts/section~)  is to
simply make a list of all the pages in a directory.  For most of 
the sections, that's fine.  

For the ~/news/~ section I wanted to only display the most-recent 10
news items, so that has a special template
~/layouts/section/news.html~ .

For the ~/people/~ section I
wanted to group people by their role: students or staff, so that has a
template.

Again, we generate the header (~header.html~) followed by the heading "Graduate Students," followed by a list,
where each entry is formatted by ~people-stub.html~.  There are two
new things here:  (1) we choose only those pages that are of ~Type~ equal to ~grad~ (this is from the metadata in the
front-matter), and (2) we sort those pages by lastname (another
metadata tag in the front matter).

Once we have disposed of the grad students, we do something
similar for the staff, and so on.

Without this template, the People page would simply have a list of
all the files in ~/content/people/~.


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE html
{{ partial "header.html" . }}

<div id="post-index" class="body-container">
  <h1 class="post-title"> People </h1>

  <h2 class="section-title"> Graduate Students </h2>
  <ol class="post-list">
    {{ $pag := where .Data.Pages "Type" "grad" }}
    {{ range ($pag.ByParam "lastname") }}
    {{ partial "people-stub.html" . }}
    {{ end }}
  </ol>

  <h2 class="section-title"> Staff & Faculty </h2>
  <ol class="post-list">
    {{ $pag := where .Data.Pages "Type" "pi" }}
    {{ range ($pag.ByParam "lastname") }}
    {{ partial "people-stub.html" . }}
    {{ end }}
  </ol>

Here is the front-matter and the first line of the content for my

The template ~/layouts/section/people.html~ uses the metadata tags ~Type~ and ~Lastname~ to group and sort the entries.
The template ~/layouts/partials//people-stub.html~ uses the metadata tags (~image~, ~room~, etc)
to generate the page.
