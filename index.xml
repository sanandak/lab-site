      <title>Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica</title>
      <link>http://www.psice.psu.edu/projects/thwaites/</link>

      <description>Thwaites Glacier is one of the largest glaciers in Antarctica. Like many glaciers in West Antarctica, it is grounded below sea level and the bed becomes deeper farther from the coast (a reverse bed slope). What that means is is that Thwaites is vulnerable to rapid /grounding-line retreat/ in response to a warming ocean.
We are conducting numerical modeling, satellite and airborne remote sensing data analysis, ground-based geophysical measurements to better project Thwaites Glacier&#39;s potential contribution to sea level rise over the coming decades and centuries.</description>

      <description>Maeva is a fourth year PhD student, who comes to us from an engineering background. She is interested in seismic tomography as well as location and source parameterization of seismic events. She is currently working with regional and teleseismic events recorded by the GLISN network to invert for the crustal and upper mantle structure beneath Greenland. Some of the goals of this project are to constrain the source of a high geothermal heat flux observed in northeast Greenland, provide valuable information about the geology within Greenland’s continental margin and obtain relatively accurate velocity and density profiles of Greenland&#39;s lithosphere that could be used to invert other dataset such as gravity data.</description>

      <description>Dave is interested in numerical modeling of the Earth&#39;s climate, including 3-D atmospheric and ocean dynamics, ice sheets and vegetation. He works mostly on paleoclimates, long-term ice sheet variations, and past vegetation-climate feedbacks. He has been at Penn State since 1997, when he moved from the National Center for Atmospheric Research after helping to develop the GENESIS Global Climate Model. Recently he has worked more on ice sheet models, coupling them with global and regional climate models and applying them to Antarctica.</description>

      <description>I am moving the PSICE site to a Hugo-based system. Hugo is a so-called &#34;Static Site Generator&#34; in which one writes the content as a text file and Hugo generates the HTML code to put on the server.
Overview of the pages generated by Hugo The theme is stolen from RPAL at Cornell, who have kindly shared their setup. The look is driven by config.toml.

      <description>Richard is an Evan Pugh Professor of the Pennsylvania State University, as well as a Professor in the Department of Geosciences. Richard is a glaciologist with training in geology and materials science from Ohio State and Wisconsin. He studies the flow and stability of ice sheets, their climate records, and the way they interact with the landscape. He used to spend a lot of time on ice sheets; now, he cheers for students going to the field and stays home to teach, and communicate with the public and policymakers.</description>

      <description>Sridhar is a Professor in the Department of Geosciences and an associate of the Earth and Environmental Sciences Institute (EESI). Sridhar teaches geophysics and glaciology and conducts research in as many cold places as he can convince folks to let him visit. So far he has done most of his fieldwork in West Antarctica and Greenland, with the occasional foray to Norway and Iceland. His interests involve using geophysical tools (seismology, ice penetrating radar, and GPS) to work out how and why glaciers flow in the ways they do.</description>

Here is a photo of the massive crack that eventually led to the formation of the massive iceberg that broke off from the Larsen C Ice Shelf. Scale is difficult to measure (the photo was taken from an airplane, and there are no known features---buildings, trees, roads--- nearby). NASA estimates that the crack is 100 m (300 ft) in width.
